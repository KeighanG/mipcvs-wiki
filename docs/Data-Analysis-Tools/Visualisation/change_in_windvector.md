### This code provides changes in wind speed and wind direction for a subset of CMIP6 models
### The first figure (a panel of 2x3 wind fields) is written for 6 CMIP6 models
### The second figure gives a multi model mean of the models given
### The input data is preprocessed using CDOs (selected time period, selected altitude of winds, as well as mean over time for specific months)
### Adapt the preprocessing as adequate for your research question
